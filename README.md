### Introduction
Project-BRD is an open source personal project management software made in the Godot Game Engine. We collect absolutely zero data and all files are stored locally on your machine. You can use this software to plan your personal projects using a board and card layout. This layout is efficient for quickly visualizing the progression of tasks.

## Pros and Const of Using Project-BRD

### What This Software Is Good At
Project-BRD is good at managing personal projects. In the current version of Project-BRD there are almost no collaboration features making it hard for multiple people to work on the same project. This software is good at managing personal projects as you can quickly visualize your progression.

### What This Software Is Bad At
This software is not without it's flaws. There are certain things this project is simply not the best at. One of those things is real time collaboration. There currently are no feature support for real time collaboration but that should hopefully be coming in the feature! This software is not good for storing notes or creating flow charts.

### Privacy And Data
Simple, we do not collect, store, or sell users' personal data. No sign-up or account creation required. That is pretty much. The only feature of the device that is needed is access to your filesystem. Without the filesystem, the program would fail to work as it stores your to-do data on your machine. It is possible that feature versions would also need internet permissions.

## More Information About The Software

### What Inspired This Software?
There are many freemium services out there that do something similar to what this program does. The only difference is that this software does not require an account and does not hide features behind a paywall. The only limitations for the amount of boards you can have is how much disk space you have. I also did not like having to remember a password to simply access a to-do list. This program fixes that as it is completely offline with no sign-up required.

### What Is Next for Project-BRD?
I hope to get many more features into the software such as realtime collaboration that I have been repeatability mentioning. I also wish to improve the note taking and mind mapping side of the app turning it into something that could actually compete with larger, more enterprise solutions.

### How can you support this software?
You can support this software various ways but one of the biggest, is to use the software yourself, and create bug reports. This keeps Project-BRD on top of the competition and makes it a better experience for everybody. I am not currently taking donations.
